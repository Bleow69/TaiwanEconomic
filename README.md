## TaiwanEconomic
#In this tutorial, you will be creating a classifcation model. The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Apply what you have learnt and come up with the optimal model to predict if a company goes bankrupt or not. 

Bonus: Determine what are the key features that influence your model. 

 PS: If you find a technique/method that you believe was not shared in class but useful; you can and should use it. No points will be deducted for trying! Do not delete your trial scripts, these will be important for you to understand where you improved from your previous attempts.

#Why did we choose a specific model to present to us e.g higher accuracy score, T-score, precision score, F1 score  


Creating an optimal classification model to predict company bankruptcy involves several steps, leveraging both statistical and machine learning techniques. Here's a structured approach:


---

1. Define the Problem and Objectives

Objective: Accurately classify companies as "bankrupt" or "not bankrupt."

Identify key metrics to evaluate performance: Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall, or AUC-ROC.

Understand the business and domain context, especially the cost of false positives vs. false negatives.

---

2. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Data Sources: Collect historical financial data, macroeconomic indicators, and other relevant factors.

Preprocessing Steps:

Handle missing data (imputation or removal).

Normalize/scale numerical features for consistency.

Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot or ordinal encoding).

Address imbalanced classes using techniques like oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling.

---

3. Feature Engineering

Extract and engineer relevant features:

Financial ratios (e.g., debt-to-equity, current ratio, profit margin).

Operational metrics (e.g., turnover rates).

Industry-specific indicators.


Conduct feature selection using:

Correlation analysis.

Recursive feature elimination (RFE).

Feature importance from tree-based models.

---

4. Train-Test Splitting

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70%-20%-10%).

Ensure the split maintains class balance.

5. Model Selection and Training
(We only learn these i know there were more)
Evaluate different algorithms:

Logistic Regression: Estimates probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class using a logistic function 
Multi-class classification - Extends binary logistic regression to handle multiple classes by using one-vs-rest (OvR) or softmax regression. Esimtates probability of each class and assigns input to the class with highest probability 

Decision Trees - Classification and Regression Tree (CART) /Random Forests: Handle non-linear relationships well.

Key Considerations for Choosing a Classification Method:
Size of the dataset
Model interpretability
Accuracy vs. speed trade-off
Each method has its strengths and is best suited to different types of classification problems depending on the dataset, computational resources, and problem complexity.

Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

6. Model Performance Evaluation

Evaluate on the test set using metrics relevant to the problem:

Confusion Matrix: Able to derive Precision, Recall, Accuracy, F1 Score
Precision & Recall: Important for imbalanced datasets.
F1-Score: Balances precision and recall.
Accuracy: shows how often a model is correct overall

AUC-ROC: Measures the trade-off between true positives and false positives.


Conduct error analysis to identify patterns in misclassifications.





---

7. Optimization

Fine-tune hyperparameters using:

Grid Search or Random Search.

Bayesian Optimization for efficiency.


Consider ensemble methods:

Bagging (e.g., Random Forest).

Boosting (e.g., Gradient Boosting).

Stacking (combine multiple model outputs)


---

Tools and Libraries:

Python Libraries: Scikit-learn

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy.

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn.

---

Example Features for Bankruptcy Prediction:

Financial: Debt ratio, quick ratio, net profit margin.

Operational: Inventory turnover, employee productivity metrics.

Macroeconomic: GDP growth rates, industry-specific trends.


Focusing on structured feature engineering, balancing interpretability with performance, and maintaining ethical considerations will enhance your model's practical utility.
